## Customer Churn Analysis at Y

A high churn rate could adversely affect profits and impede growth. In most areas, many of the companies compete, making it easy for people to transfer from one service to another. A company can compare its new subscribers versus its loss of subscribers to determine both its churn rate and growth rate to see if there was overall growth or loss in a specific time period. While the churn rate tracks lost customers, the growth rate tracks new customers. If the growth rate is higher than the churn rate, the company experienced growth. When the churn rate is higher than the growth rate, the company experienced a loss in its customer base. In this project, the growth team at Y is interested in understanding why and which users withdraw money from their Y account. A user is considered churned when their equity value falls below $100 for a period of 28 consecutive calender days or longer.

I try to answer the following questions:

1) What percentage of users have churned in the data provided?
2) Build a classifier using "training data" that given a user with their features assigns a churn probability for every user and predicts which users will churn. 3)
3) How well does your classifier perform on the "test data"? Your metric is accuracy.
4) Based on the classifier (model you built) classify each user in the dataset as churned or not churned.
