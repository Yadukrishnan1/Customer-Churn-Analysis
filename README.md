## Customer-Churn-Analysis at Y

The growth team at Y is interested in understanding why and which users withdraw money from their Y account. A user is considered churned when their equity value falls below $100 for a period of 28 consecutive calender days or longer

I try to answer the following questions:

1) What percentage of users have churned in the data provided?
2) Build a classifier using "training data" that given a user with their features assigns a churn probability for every user and predicts which users will churn. 3)
3) How well does your classifier perform on the "test data"? Your metric is accuracy.
4) Based on the classifier (model you built) classify each user in the dataset as churned or not churned.

Datasets: features_data,
          equity_value_data
